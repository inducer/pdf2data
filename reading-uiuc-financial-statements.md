# Reading UIUC Financial Statements with pdf2data

This tool aims to read financial statements made available through the `my.dept` system.
In particular, it is designed to read the

* Operating Ledger Transaction Statement
* Payroll Labor Distribution

reports. It works around the (at least as far as I know)  unavailability of
bulk export of financial information from UI systems. It (currently) works for
me with a 1000-odd page PDF that comes out of the "Customize Combined
Statements" function, for all my active accounts, since "the beginning of
time".

If you are lucky, at the end of the process you will be left with a SQLite3
file containing the same information as the giant PDF. But you should not be
confused: This is an absurd, brittle process. The tool generally tries to be
somewhat careful and error out if it is confused, but if you make crucial
business decisions based on data generated by this tool, and that data turns
out to be wrong, you know who to blame. (Not me.)

Once you have the file, I highly recommend
[SQLiteBrowser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) for analyzing it. If you don't know
[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), simply try and extrapolate from the
queries below. You'll be right most of the time. Alternatively, I hear the
CS department has a course. :)

Here are some queries I've found useful:
